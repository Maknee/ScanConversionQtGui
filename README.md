# ScanConversionQtGui
Entire GUI is made in C++/Qt Library. Features a scan converter and post processing effects. 

Unfortunately, most of the code is organized in one h/cpp file, but the code is commented and organized. Some awkward additions of C/older C++ syntax may exist since there is imported code from previous projects into this GUI project.
